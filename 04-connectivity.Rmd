# Street Connectivity {#connect}

## Cross-sectional (wave 1) analysis

### Using categorical street connectivity and age {-}

```{r connect_cross mod 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/cross mod 1.png"))
```

```{r connect_cross mod 1 fig, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/cross mod 1 fig.png"))
```

### Using continuous street connectivity and age {-}

```{r connect_cross mod 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/cross mod 2.png"))
```

```{r connect_cross mod 2 fig, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/cross mod 2 fig.png"))
```

## Longitudinal analysis

### Using categorical street connectivity and age {-}

```{r connect_long mod 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/long mod 1.png"))
```

```{r connect_long mod 1 fig, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/long mod 1 fig.png"))
```

### Using continuous street connectivity and age {-}

```{r connect_long mod 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/long mod 2.png"))
```

```{r connect_long mod 2 fig, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Connectivity/long mod 2 fig.png"))
```

<!-- ## Footnotes -->

<!-- Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.].  -->

<!-- ## Citations -->

<!-- Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`. -->

<!-- For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).  -->
<!-- Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key. -->


<!-- The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations> -->
