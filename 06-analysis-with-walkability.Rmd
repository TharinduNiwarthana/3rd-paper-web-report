# Analysis including walkability index {#walk}

As we discussed in the meeting, I dropped streetlight and added walkability index to this analysis. Here, only the longitudinal models using continuous BE attributes and age, are presented.

Walkability index was calculated averaging the sum of standardized residential density, street connectivity, and land-use mix variables. These variables were standardized at each wave instead of all five waves data pooling together. Then the index was re-scaled to range between 0 and 100 for better interpretation.

## Main effects analysis

### Summary of findings {-}

```{r main effects summary table, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Analysis with walkability/main effects summary table.png"))
```

-   Main effects of all the BE attributes explored are statistically significant for positive associations
-   One unit increase in residential density is 
-   There is a 1.04 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in residential density (Model 1).
-   There is a 1.03 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in street connectivity (Model 2).
-   There is a 5.66 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in land-use mix (Model 3).
-   There is a 1.03 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in walkability (Model 5).
-   The effect of land-use mix largely attunuated compared to other variables when the models were adjusted for other two BE attributes (Model 4).
-   Please note that these odds ratios are not comparable across variables as the variables are not standardized.

#### Residential density model (Model 1) {-}

#### Street connectivity model (Model 2) {-}

```{r con main mod, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Analysis with walkability/con main mod.png"))

#### Land-use mix model (Model 3) {-}

```{r lan main mod, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#### Full main effects model (Model 4) {-}

```{r full main mod, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#### Walkability index model (Model 5) {-}

```{r walk main mod, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

## Interaction effects analysis

### Summary of findings {-}

```{r interaction effects summary table, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("Results/Analysis with walkability/interaction effects summary table.png"))
```

-   Only residential density and scaled walkability index variables showed a significant interaction effects with age on transport walking.
-   Though the interaction effect between land-use mix and age was statistically insignificant, its interaction plot showed a large difference in the proportions of walkers at low levels of land-use mix compared to high levels.
