Each of these BE variable was tested for interaction effect with age as categorical and continuous variables. Both cross-sectional (wave 1) and longitudinal models and their interaction plots were used to investigate the interaction effects. 1.1 Summary of findings Streetlight showed a significant interaction only in a cross-sectional model which used continuous SL and age variables. See chapter 3 Residential density showed a significant interaction with age in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, and also in both categorical and continuous analysis. The interaction plots were non-parallel. See chapter 4 Street connectivity did not show a significant interaction with age in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Interaction plot in the longitudinal analysis was parallel clearly showing not existence of the interaction. See chapter 5 Land-use mix did not have a significant interaction with age in both types of models. Interaction plots in the longitudinal analysis looks nearly parallel supporting the statistical insignificance of the interaction term. See chapter 6 Longitudinal models summary table These models used continuous variables of the BE attributes and age. "],["preliminary-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Preliminary Analysis", " Chapter 2 Preliminary Analysis Similar to the analysis of my second paper, I used the mixed-effects logistic regressions to model the associations. I tested for the interaction effect between streetlight count and age groups. Age grouping was done in two different ways as follows and tested if the interaction effect is significant. Age grouping methods. Participants’ age was grouped using baseline age. Age groups: 39 &lt; 45, 45 &lt; 50, 50 &lt; 55, 55 &lt; 60, and 60 &lt; 67 Participants’ age was grouped as younger (below 65) and older (65 or above) adults dynamically. In this case participants’ age group may change over time as they age. The following line graphs were drawn considering the baseline age groups (method 1). Figure 1 shows that the proportion of walkers increase over time and younger age groups have higher proportion of walkers compared to older age groups over time. However, the above statistical models (Table 1 &amp; 2) did not show significant interaction effect, suggesting no statistically significant differences in the longitudinal association between streetlight and transport walking for different age groups. This is also may be due to the transport walking measurement issue as we saw in my second paper (sex difference paper). Participants with low streetlights (Q1) and high streetlights (Q5) were separately illustrated in Figure 2. Low streetlights neighbourhoods seem to have low proportion of walkers and increases the proportion over time except for the 60 &lt; 67 baseline age group. High streetlight neighbourhoods seem to have higher proportion of walkers compared to low streetlight neighbourhoods, and this proportion seem to stay constant over time. Regression models stratified for low and high streetlight also did not show any significant interactions between streetlight count and age group, suggesting no significant differences in the association for different age groups. Both types of age groupings were tested here.

Here, only the longitudinal models using continuous BE attributes and age, are presented. Walkability index was calculated averaging the sum of standardized residential density, street connectivity, and land-use mix variables. These variables were standardized at each wave instead of all five waves data pooling together. Then the index was re-scaled to range between 0 and 100 for better interpretation. 7.1 Main effects analysis Summary of findings Main effects of all the BE attributes explored are statistically significant for positive associations One unit increase in residential density is There is a 1.04 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in residential density (Model 1). There is a 1.03 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in street connectivity (Model 2). There is a 5.66 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in land-use mix (Model 3). There is a 1.03 odds for a participant to be a walker with one unit increase in walkability (Model 5). The effect of land-use mix largely attunuated compared to other variables when the models were adjusted for other two BE attributes (Model 4). Please note that these odds ratios are not comparable across variables as the variables are not standardized.

Though the interaction effect between land-use mix and age was statistically insignificant, its interaction plot showed a large difference in the proportions of walkers at low levels of land-use mix compared to high levels.
